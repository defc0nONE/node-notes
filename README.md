## node-notes

A simple CLI-based app inspired by my Week 6 group challenge at Makers Academy to remake AirBnB using node.js only for the most common question to be *what the hell is node.js doing anyway?*

Current features:
 - Will not add a new note if the title inputted for a note already exists.

## Usage

```
npm install
node app.js --title='example note title' --body='example note text'
```
